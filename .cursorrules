You are an expert in Python, Typer, OpenAI's Whisper, and scalable speech-to-text application development, integrating LLMs and robust logging frameworks.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_transcribed, has_audio).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., whisper/transcription_utils.py).
- Favor named exports for transcription utilities and preprocessing functions.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

Python/Whisper/LLMs
- Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models for structured data handling and input validation when required.
- Integrate LLM interactions using https://ai.pydantic.dev/ for structured prompts and responses.
- File structure: exported transcription utilities, models for data schemas, auxiliary scripts for preprocessing, and modules for LLM interactions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).

Error Handling and Validation
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages using https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/pydantic/ for all logging needs.
  - Use Pydantic models to validate and parse complex inputs, reducing manual validation code.

Dependencies
- Pydantic v2
- Async libraries like asyncio for non-blocking operations
- Libraries for audio processing, such as ffmpeg and librosa
- LogFire for logging
- AI Pydantic for LLM interactions
- uv for packaging, building, and running Python

Whisper-Specific and LLM Guidelines
- Use Whisper’s pretrained models for transcription tasks, selecting appropriate model sizes for accuracy and performance trade-offs.
- Use functional components (plain functions) for preprocessing, transcription, and postprocessing.
- Use declarative workflows for processing pipelines with clear parameter and return type annotations.
- Optimize audio preprocessing with tools like ffmpeg to ensure compatibility and quality for Whisper.
- Use Pydantic’s BaseModel for managing structured input and output data in transcription pipelines, ensuring robustness and consistency.
- Implement error handling for common issues like missing audio files, incompatible formats, and insufficient system resources.
- For LLM-related tasks, ensure prompt consistency and response validation using AI Pydantic for schema-based validation.
- Use logging utilities integrated with LogFire for detailed monitoring and debugging.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize blocking operations; use asynchronous workflows for I/O-bound tasks such as loading audio files or saving transcriptions.
- Use caching strategies for frequently accessed models and configurations.
- Optimize audio preprocessing and segmentation for large audio files to improve transcription speed.
- Use GPU acceleration where possible to enhance Whisper’s transcription performance.
- Batch process multiple transcription tasks to maximize throughput on available hardware.

Project Setup and Management with uv
This project will utilize [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) exclusively for packaging, building, and running Python code. This approach ensures a streamlined and efficient workflow.

Adding Dependencies with `uv add`
To add dependencies to your project, use the `uv add` command. This command updates your `pyproject.toml` and installs the specified packages into your project's environment. For example, to add the `requests` and `rich` packages:

```bash
$ uv add requests rich
```

This command will:
- Update the `dependencies` section in your `pyproject.toml`.
- Install the specified packages into your project's virtual environment.

For more details, refer to the [Managing Dependencies](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/) section in the uv documentation.

Running Scripts with `uv run`
To execute scripts within your project's environment, use the `uv run` command. This ensures that the script runs with the project's dependencies properly configured. For instance, to run a script named `example.py`:

```bash
$ uv run example.py
```

This command will:
- Ensure the project's environment is up-to-date.
- Execute the specified script within that environment.

For more information, see the [Running Commands](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/run/) section in the uv documentation.

Running Tests with `uv run tests`
To execute tests within your project's environment, use the `uv run tests` command. This ensures that the tests run with the project's dependencies properly configured.

```bash
$ uv run tests
```

This command will:
- Ensure the project's environment is up-to-date.
- Execute the specified test script within that environment.


Project Initialization and Environment Management
To initialize a new project, use the `uv init` command:

```bash
$ uv init 
```
The `pyproject.toml` file contains your project's metadata and dependencies. The `.python-version` file specifies the Python version for the project. The `.venv` directory, which is created upon adding dependencies or running scripts, contains the isolated virtual environment for your project.

For detailed information, refer to the [Working on Projects](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) guide in the uv documentation.

Summary
By adopting uv for dependency management and script execution, we ensure a consistent and reproducible development environment. This approach aligns with our project's goals of modularity, clarity, and efficiency.
